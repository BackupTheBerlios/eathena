Here's the webserver API, so you can work on the webserver.

My personal goal is to make this interface simple, so that coding it
will be like coding in some scripting language...

char *get_param(char in_string[500], char swhat[500]);

This function simply returns various data from the query string.
	*Pass get_param NOTHING longer than 500 in length!

	What do I pass where in_string is?
		The query string.

	What do I pass where swhat is?
		One of two things...
		Either 0 for the path of the 'page'
		or you can pass it the param you wish to lookup.
