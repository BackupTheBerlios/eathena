Thank you for downloading Athena.

Easy way:
To setup Athena, first run the setupwizard program.  This will assist you
in configuring Athena for the first time.
If you screw up, just run the program again.

To add users go to the tool directory and run the adduser program.

Now run char-server, map-server, and login-server programs in the main
Athena directory.

You're done!


To play:
Run the server and make sure your sclientinfo.xml file has all the correct
settings.
